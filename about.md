# MQTT

#This project a task given to me.
it is supposed to be a page that Presents MQTT service

#The new things learned in this project:
   1)what is mqtt service and how it works
   2)got to know more about websockets
   3)learned hoe to use heroku

#Complications:
 1)how to install the mosquitto broker local -->> took alot of time
 2)cloudmqtt -->> could not add it to the heroku to use it


#My thoughts during the project :
1)there could have been more resources as some of the resources is outdated
